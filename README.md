# Redirecting from Reddit.com

RF supports handling standard Reddit URLs as location hashes. You can therefore use the [Redirector](https://github.com/einaregilsson/Redirector) browser extension to route all Reddit links to RF.

# Notes

- Because RF does not provide its own backend it's limited by CORS policies. You may need to disable your browser's "enhanced tracking protection" for this site for it to work.
- Although Add to Home Screen is supported on most browsers, the experience on mobile is subjectively better as a normal site as external links display in new tabs.
