RF is a portable Reddit frontend distributed as a single HTML file that **still works** with Reddit's new API policy. Try it [here](https://rf.alexkoen.com/#/r/eyebleach+programming) or download it to your device.

:warning: You may need to disable Firefox's "Enhanced Tracking Protection", which prevents RF from making CORS requests to reddit.com. See [notes](#notes).

# Redirecting from Reddit.com

RF supports handling standard Reddit URLs as location hashes. You can therefore use the [Redirector](https://github.com/einaregilsson/Redirector) browser extension to route all Reddit links to RF.

# Notes

- Because RF does not provide its own backend it's limited by CORS policies. You may need to disable your browser's "enhanced tracking protection" for this site for it to work.

- Although Add to Home Screen is supported on most browsers, the experience on mobile is subjectively better as a normal site as external links display in new tabs.
